					<strong>Looking for a new culture</strong>
				</h2>
					By learn about entrepreneurship, reading books over business and reading biographies of persons that I found interesting such as Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Steve Jobs, Richard Branson, Mark Zuckerberg, Carlos Garcia Ottati, Carlos Slim, Marcos Galperin and other entrepreneurs both from Latin American and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, I realize that there was an "startups ecosystem" where everything seemed to be possible, where very cool people meet, and 
					there is desire of make great things.
					<br>
					It's actually clear when you're working with people who think to do a good job matters, as Steve Jobs said: "Greatest people are self-managing. They don't need to be managed. Once they know what to do, they'll go figure out how to do it and they don't need to be managed at all. What they need is a common vision and that's what leadership is".
					<br>
					I saw one important difference between working in a startup and working in a conventional company. This is, people who's working in a startup (at less the founders and the first employees) really believe in the mission of the company and don't works just because work have to be done but it's because something that they really believe in. That is meaningful work, and that is something I wanted for myself.
					<br>
					Another particularity I saw in how startups works is related to hypergrowth. Startups have the capability of growth over a rate of 5 to 10 percent per week! Although that can't last forever, people who's working in a startups must be able to learn fast and keep learning all the time. You can't keep a growth rate of 10x per quarter (three-month period) if you don't learn how to scale your product or service to all those people and learn to deal with each problem that comes: operative, financial, legal problems etc.
					<br>
					However, in almost all interviews I've watched of people who worked at statups, they said have been the most rewarding thing of their lives.

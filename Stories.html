					Get out of your little town!
				</h2>
				<p id="story1_modal" class="story_p-modal">
					By learn about entrepreneurship, reading books over business and reading biographies of persons that I found interesting such as Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Steve Jobs, Richard Branson, Mark Zuckerberg, Carlos Garcia Ottati, Carlos Slim, Marcos Galperin and other entrepreneurs both from Latin American and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, I realize that there was an "startups ecosystem" where everything seemed to be possible, where very cool people meet, and 
					there is desire of make great things.
					<br>
					It's actually clear when you're working with people who think to do a good job matters, as Steve Jobs said: "Greatest people are self-managing. They don't need to be managed. Once they know what to do, they'll go figure out how to do it and they don't need to be managed at all. What they need is a common vision and that's what leadership is".
					<br>
					I saw one important difference between working in a startup and working in a conventional company. This is, people who's working in a startup (at less the founders and the first employees) really believe in the mission of the company and don't works just because work have to be done but it's because something that they really believe in. That is meaningful work, and that is something I wanted for myself.
					<br>
					Another particularity I saw in how startups works is related to hypergrowth. Startups have the capability of growth over a rate of 5 to 10 percent per week! Although that can't last forever, people who's working in a startups must be able to learn fast and keep learning all the time. You can't keep a growth rate of 10x per quarter (three-month period) if you don't learn how to scale your product or service to all those people and learn to deal with each problem that comes: operative, financial, legal problems etc.
					<br>
					However, in almost all interviews I've watched of people who worked at statups, they said have been the most rewarding thing of their lives.
					<br>
					<br>
					<strong>What is not in the agro industry</strong>
					<br>
					I graduated from Instituto Tecnologico Superior de Tacambaro as sustainable agricultural innovation engineer. I wanted work at the best companies like Bayer, Idai Nature, Syngenta, Basf, or any startup that was doing innovative things. Well, I searched for a job in that companies but they required for a seasoned engineer in specific areas and I still didn't have my first job at the industry.
					<br>
					I could get a couple of jobs at local companies in Tacambaro, and, some employees are pretty good at their jobs but, in general there aren't good workers and the management wasn't well either. You can realize when you're on the right path and things like the culture, meaningful work, innovation and progress in general, those things were important to me, and any company could fill those needs.
					<br>
					I think people rarely wonder how far does they wanna go and what is their goal in life or, at least where they want to be the in the next three years or the next year. If all it's going well - what I've seen to most people means to have enought earnings to live and have no laks, to be able to buy somethings they like haven't work so much - that's fine for some people and when they get it, they suppose they are already good and adopt a very passive attitude, don't doing more than the absolutely necessary. Some of them thinks how to get more money but don't make a plan and don't lead their lives, just wait to see what happens. And if you're open with them and talk with them what you want to achieve, they tell you are an idiot for to want it and that you'll never get it, they tell you that look the reality - their reality - and particularly when you're starting your career, if you have great ambitions, most likely is you will work with people that don't have it and working with those people you have to hide your ambitions and certainly you have to be average to don't seem "hateful", because they think you seem better than them and that bother them, especially if you're younger.
					<br>
					All work theams have a pace of work, bad workers get irritated if someone speed it up because they don't want to work more. But if you aren't trying make a better job you stagnate and won't be better. So, those teams prevent your growth and I coudn't allow that.
					<br>
					I wanted to work next to great people, people that I admire, to be able to learn from them and then be able to contribute something, but that is hard to find in almost all industries.
					<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Tech Industry</strong>
					<br>
					That work culture is more likely to find
					in tech companies that are looking for create new things or propose new products to improve how things are made nowadays, because they really care what they do and believe they are changing the world. And I just wnated to be part of that ecosystem.
					<br>
					Pondering abou that I realized I couldn't achieve it in my town (Tacámbaro). I knew several companies and I could not grow in any of them because lack of that culture. I would grow very little and would delay many years, that was something ridiculous. Also I knew some managers of my town and I wouldn't like to be like them and to do what they are doing. They are nothing awesome compared to Elon Musk, Larry Elison, Jack Dorsey, Justin Kan, Carlos García Ottati, Marcos Galperin and other great founders, and that was accurately what I aspired to.
					<br>
					So, if I wanted do greatest things I had to go where great things were being done. I had to get in that ecosystem to increase my chances of success instead of try to create the ecosystem in my town, what would be even much dificult and didn't make much sense because I don't even knew how that ecosystem was.
